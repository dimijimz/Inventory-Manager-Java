# Inventory-Manager-Java
For my Intro to Java final project, I developed an efficient Inventory Management System using Java. It features a robust backend, user-friendly interfaces, and data validation. This project enhanced my skills in Java programming, OOP, and database management. Users can seamlessly add, update, delete, and view inventory items.
