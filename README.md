# Inventory-Manager-Java
For my Intro to Java final project, I developed an efficient Inventory Management System using Java. This project included creating a robust backend, user-friendly interfaces, and ensuring data integrity. I gained experience in Java programming, object-oriented design, and database management. The system allows users to add, update, delete, and view inventory items seamlessly, showcasing my ability to create practical solutions.
